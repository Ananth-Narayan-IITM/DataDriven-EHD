# Data Driven Modeling of Complex Aerospace Systems and Fluid Flows (AS5401)
## Aim
To linearize the Bipolar EHD (coupled non-linear PDE's- without Navier Stokes) through single and multiparameter DMD and further apply SINDy to get the governing equations from the data.
## Description
From OpenFOAM solver (\vec{u} = 0), the bipolar species equations shall be solved in one-dimensional system (two-dimensional geometry) to acquire the species variations for various M, Co etc., and considering the Onsager function to be neglected.
## TODO
- [ ] Decide the governing equation and variables
- [ ] Acquire the suitable solver/ case (if needed create/modify)
- [ ] Verify the solver, geometry, parameters, schemes, solution controls
